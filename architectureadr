 Architecture Decision record 1 for development framework 

Context 
 We need a framework to build the 3 X O game app for Android Devices. We have very limited mobile development experience, so we decided to also choose a framework that is beginner friendly. 

Options Considered 

React Native 

Ionic 

Cordova 

Native Script 

Framework7 

Decision 
 We went with React Native. 

Rationale 

Easiest for beginners 

Uses JavaScript (which we know) 

Works great for small games 

Runs natively on Android 

Consequences 
 Positive: 

Fast development 

big online support 

good Android performance 

Negative: 

needs Node.js setup 

Must learn component-based UI 

Architecture Decision record 2 for navigation strategy 

Context 
 The app will only use one main gameplay screen, so complex navigation is not needed. 

Options Considered 

Stack navigation 

Tab navigation 

Single-screen navigation 

Decision 
 Went with single-screen navigation. 

Rationale 

The game only needs one view 

Simple for beginners 

Reduces complexity 

Consequences 
 Positive: 

No unnecessary navigation code 

Easier to maintain 

Negative: 

Harder to scale if we add more screens later 

 

Architecture Decision record 3 for hardware                                                                           Context 
 Our  3 X O Tic Tac Toe app does not need access to device hardware. The app only requires touch interaction from the user. 

Options Considered 

GPS 

Speaker 

Camera 

Fingerprint scanner 

None 

Decision 
 We choose none. 

Rationale 

Game does not require hardware features 

Keeps the permissions minimal 

Reduces  complexity 

Consequences 
 Positive: 

No security permissions 

Simpler code 

Negative: 

No negative, since hardware isn’t needed. 

 

 Architecture Decision record 4 For Data storage 

Context 
 3 X O only displays a 3×3 board. It does not need to store long-term data. 

Options Considered 

Local unencrypted database 

Local encrypted database 

Remote cloud database 

No database 

Decision 
 We went with No database. 

Rationale 

Nothing needs to be saved permanently 

No accounts, scores, or user history 

Simplifies development 

Consequences 
 Positive: 

Very simple architecture 

No database setup 

No security issues 

Negative: 

Cannot save long-term statistics unless we add it later
